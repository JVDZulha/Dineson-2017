# Dineson-2017
Xcode application for Fall 2017 Software Engineering project.
Requirements
First Draft
Jacob, Brett, Federico, Josh, Michael
1. Statement
We plan to develop a mobile application that allows students to easily locate
dining hall menus, which will be updated to display current meal options
available. Hours of operation for each dining hall will also be provided with the
possibility of advertising events and/or closings during the school year. We also
provide a way for students to rate and comment (180 characters or less) on
meals or specific food items such that the students may submit and
receive feedback on food options and know what others enjoyed. We plan
to provide this application on both the apple store and google play to provide
this service to as many students as possible.
2. Timeline and Milestones
Project must be completed by 12/11/2017. Our major milestone ideals are and
will be completed as follows:
● Acquiring the Bon Appetit Menu: Oct. 1st
● Regular access/updating: Oct. 14th
● Rating and Commenting System: Oct. 21 st ● User Interface: Oct.
7th
● Hours of operation: Oct. 14th.
● A functioning application: Nov. 1 st
● A functioning application (available for download): Dec. 1st
3. Cost Estimate
Our team is under the impression that there is no monetary cost to this project,
only time. Our team with all of our schedules kept in mind, are willing to
commit a maximum of 2 hours a day, 5 days a week. This should provide a
suitable amount of time to complete the project. *Subject to change based on
unforeseen circumstances. 
4. Equipment
The only hardware equipment we’ll need will be the Olin Linux lab to develop
the application. For software, we will be using Xamerin which is free for
download on all devices.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
We are considering a login system, such as email, to increase accountability
and deter people from writing irrelevant comments. We plan to have a
minimal response time for retrieving menus and hours of operation (less
than 10 seconds.) Also a major part of our application is to promote user
friendliness with accessing this information for students. We plan to make
the transition from opening the app to retrieving desired information as efficient
as possible.
6. Communication
Communication between the development team will be done through the
use of the GroupMe app and weekly in-person meetings. This will allow for
thorough sharing of ideas and expectations for the project. Communication
between our clients is still unclear. Once an initial meet up has been completed
with DU food services and DU tech support; more detail will be provided.
7. Possible Risks
General Deterrents: Scheduling conflicts between dev team members,
expectation conflict with clients, base website query is inadequate, etc.
Josh - Out of town overnight for football 9 /15-9/16 and 10 /6-10/7.
Jake/Brett - Nov. 30th - Dec. 2 nd swim competition
8. Assessment
The project should be assessed on delivery of basic functions including:
fundamental UI + navigation, listing of pertinent information ( dining hall
hours, menus), and updates to above. Assessment from our clients will be done
through our weekly meetings through an agile project scheme.
9. Training
This application is being developed with a no client training mentality. We
intend to develop the app with an extremely intuitive ui that uses many android
and iPhone specific functional tools. The only training concern lies in the
handoff of app maintenance post development. 
10.Documentation
Our documentation will mostly be in the form of our weekly reports. These
reports will keep record of our progress and features developed. We also
plan to have a help section within the application that will have FAQ’s as well
as guides for using functions within the application.
11.Maintenance
Our hope is to create a standalone app that can function without constant
maintenance from our team or the client. If bugs are found and/or changes are
needed to coincide with updates to feeder websites, we will train someone
who can do the maintenance.
